**WARN: (TA-976):	Path groups asserted by the group_path constraint are considered by the software to be global in nature - they cannot be restricted to specific constraint modes. Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1182):	The clock_gating_cells property has no usable full-cycle clock gates for power domain auto-default. Gating limited for clock tree clock. You may be able to solve this problem by specifying a list of lib_cells to use with the clock_gating_cells property.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4313):	Innovus cannot determine the drive strength of clock, which drives the root of clock_tree clock. To time this clock tree, Innovus will assume that it is driven by a driver cell with a fixed output slew of 0.000 and a maximum driven capacitance of 0.000. It is recommended that you set the source_driver property on this clock tree appropriately in order to correct this assumption.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

Node the root driver for clock_tree clock at (346.220,908.800), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clock which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}, has 302 fanout.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
