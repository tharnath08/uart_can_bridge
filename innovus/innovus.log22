**WARN: (TA-976):	Path groups asserted by the group_path constraint are considered by the software to be global in nature - they cannot be restricted to specific constraint modes. Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

**WARN: (IMPSYC-2):	Timing information is not defined for cell pad_corner; Check the timing library (.lib) file and make sure the timing information exists for the cell and you can run the checkTimingLibrary command to verify if the timing library has complete information after the design is loaded.
