**WARN: (TA-976):	Path groups asserted by the group_path constraint are considered by the software to be global in nature - they cannot be restricted to specific constraint modes. Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1182):	The clock_gating_cells property has no usable full-cycle clock gates for power domain auto-default. Gating limited for clock tree clock. You may be able to solve this problem by specifying a list of lib_cells to use with the clock_gating_cells property.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4313):	Innovus cannot determine the drive strength of clock, which drives the root of clock_tree clock. To time this clock tree, Innovus will assume that it is driven by a driver cell with a fixed output slew of 0.000 and a maximum driven capacitance of 0.000. It is recommended that you set the source_driver property on this clock tree appropriately in order to correct this assumption.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Fanout Violations

Node the root driver for clock_tree clock at (357.700,948.560), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clock which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}, has 302 fanout.
